# Efficient E-Waste Management System Using IoT

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an IoT-based E-Waste Management System designed to automatically monitor and manage electronic and common waste. The system uses the **ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U** microcontroller for real-time control, cloud monitoring, and alert generation.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Automatic detection of bin fill levels using ultrasonic sensors
- Real-time monitoring via Blynk IoT platform
- LCD display for system status
- Motor and servo control for waste handling
- Cloud alerts when bins reach threshold levels
- Modular design supporting simulation and real hardware testing

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller:** ESP32-S3-MINI-1/1U  
- **Programming:** Embedded C (Arduino framework)
- **IoT Platform:** Blynk
- **Simulation:** Proteus
- **Image Processing:** MATLAB
- **Hardware:** Ultrasonic Sensors, Servo Motor, DC Motors, LCD


## 🔌 System Operation
- Ultrasonic sensors measure waste levels
- ESP32 processes data and updates LCD display
- Data is sent to the Blynk cloud for remote monitoring
- Alerts are generated when bins are full
- Servo and motors control waste movement
